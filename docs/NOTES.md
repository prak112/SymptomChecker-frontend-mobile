# Essential Technologies for React Native Development


## Core Technologies

### 1. JavaScript/TypeScript Fundamentals
- ES6+ features (async/await, destructuring, arrow functions)
- TypeScript is recommended for type safety and better IDE support
- Knowledge of React hooks and functional components

### 2. React Native CLI or Expo
- **Expo (Recommended for beginners)**
  - Managed workflow with pre-built solutions
  - Easier setup and deployment
  - Access to extensive library of ready-to-use components
  - Limitations with native modules

- **React Native CLI**
  - Full control over native code
  - Better performance optimization
  - Access to all native modules
  - More complex setup

### 3. Development Environment
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- IDE (VS Code recommended with extensions)
- Platform-specific tools:
  - iOS: Xcode (Mac only)
  - Android: Android Studio
  - Android SDK
  - JDK (Java Development Kit)


## Essential Concepts

### 1. Mobile-Specific Components
- Native components vs. web components
  - `View` (instead of `div`)
  - `Text` (instead of `p`)
  - `TouchableOpacity`/`Pressable` (instead of `button`)
  - `ScrollView`/`FlatList` (for scrollable content)

### 2. Layout and Styling
- Flexbox for React Native
- Platform-specific styling
- Responsive design using Dimensions API
- Understanding density-independent pixels (dp)

### 3. Navigation
- React Navigation (most popular solution)
  - Stack navigation
  - Tab navigation
  - Drawer navigation

### 4. State Management
- Context API (built into React)
- Redux (if needed for larger applications)
- AsyncStorage (mobile equivalent of localStorage)


## Important Libraries & Tools

### 1. Essential Libraries
- @react-navigation/native
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- react-native-vector-icons
- react-native-gesture-handler

### 2. Development Tools
- React Native Debugger
- Flipper (for debugging)
- Metro bundler
- React DevTools

### 3. Testing Tools
- Jest
- React Native Testing Library
- Detox for E2E testing


## Platform-Specific Considerations

### 1. iOS
- Understanding iOS guidelines
- Cocoapods for dependency management
- iOS-specific APIs and components

### 2. Android
- Material Design guidelines
- Gradle for build configuration
- Android-specific APIs and components


## Development Workflow

### 1. Setting Up Development Environment
1. Install Node.js
2. Install platform-specific tools
3. Set up simulators/emulators
4. Configure IDE

### 2. Project Structure Best Practices
```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── assets/
├── App.js
└── package.json
```

### 3. Debugging Tools
- Console logging
- Chrome Developer Tools
- React Native Debugger
- Platform-specific logging


## Additional Skills

### 1. API Integration
- RESTful APIs
- GraphQL
- WebSockets for real-time features

### 2. Mobile-Specific Features
- Push notifications
- Camera/photo library access
- Geolocation
- Device storage
- App permissions

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Image optimization
- Memory management
- JavaScript bundle size
- Animation performance
